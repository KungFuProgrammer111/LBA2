# LBA2
Twinsen's little big adventure - savegames - steam achievements



BACKUP YOUR ORIGINAL SAVEGAMES!!

THEY SHOULD BE IN ONE OF THOSE LoCATIONS:

1. C:\Users\[YOUR-USERNAME]\Saved Games\2point21\tlba2-classic\Save
2. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\[YOUR-STEAM-USERNAME]\398000\

For sure the savgames itself have an ".LBA" formatted file-ending.
