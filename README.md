FULL WALKTHROUGH:
-------------


The Rain
-------------
At the beginning, go to get the Magic Ball. Head for the museum, enter it through the window at the top, hit the switches, run down to get your tunic.

Go to the cliffs near the flowers circle and jump down onto the road near the Tralue's cave's entrance. Enter the cave. Ignore Raph, stand behind the barrels and throw your magic ball at the switch on the other side.

Pass on to the next room, do a running jump onto the ladder and climb it. Follow the path until the closed gate, change into discreet mode and hit the switch on the other side with your Magic Ball. Meet Joe.

Pass on, fight the first Tralü and get the key. Jump onto the rock on the left, jump onto the platform, head down for the second Tralue. Kill it and get the second key. Go up the stairs again and jump over the obstacles on the narrow path to the locked gate. Enter and cross the bridge quickly, and exit the room at the other side.

Fall down, kill the Tralü with your Magic Ball or aggressive mode. Get its key, drop down into Raph's cell and open the door from the inside. Run after Raph and meet Zoé on the cave's exit.

Back at your house, take the path past Dino-Fly to the lighthouse and talk to the Weather Wizard standing in front of the lighthouse's door.

To Desert Island
-------------
Get 10 Kashes. Go into the Ticket shop at the harbour. Read the poster about the Temple of Bù to know about Desert Island, then talk to the clerk and buy a ticket to Desert Island. Head for the ferry, reveal your ticket and board it.

On Desert Island, go into town and get the Gallic Acid from either the Healing Wizard's house or the shop. Go to Baldino and get the car part. Go back to the ticket office (12 Kashes needed), get a ticket and take the ferry back to Citadel Island.

Go to Zoé and give her the car part. Also go to your neighbor and give him the Gallic Acid, to receive the pyramid key in return. Back to the harbour, buy another ticket (10 Kashes) and take the ferry to Desert Island again.

Go to Baldino and get the Portable radio from him. Wait for Zoé to call you, then head down to the harbour to get your car. You can buy a ticket right now (12 Kashes) to avoid having to return to Port-Ludo later.

Drive the car over the ramps onto the rock with the Balsam flower and pick the flower. Drive or jump down to the Temple Park, enter, and jump down the well to get Kashes. Go back outside and jump down again to get more Kashes, until you've got 120.

Enter the graveyard through the way by the trees, and enter the School of Magic. Pass on to the second room, and jump from table to table to the other side. Use discreet mode past the fire-spitting wall and get the key. Jump over the tables back, open the gate and meet the Grand Rector.

Pay the entry fee and head to the blowgun test room. Hit the targets in time and receive the blowgun. Also show the rector the flower to get the Horn of the Blue Triton. Head back out, get back to the harbour and take the ferry again to Citadel Island.

Go to Dino-Fly and heal him with the horn. Fly with him to the Dome of the Slate. Pass through the Dome and get the Magic Slate after finishing. Get back to Dino-Fly and leave for Desert Island.

Go to the School of Magic again and receive your diploma. Get 50 Kashes and find the travelling salesman to get the Wizard's tunic. Go to the Hacienda and talk to the Esmer in front of the men's bath. Agree to go with him.

On the shuttle, view the tourist video and collect the translator. Wait until the shuttle lands.

The Esmer Invasion

Follow the esmers and enter the passage where you meet Joé. In the prison, talk to Joé. When the door opens, run past the guard, hit the switch to the left to open the back door and get out of the prison. Kill the robot to blast a hole in the fence.

Go through the dogs' traning course into the reception of the Spaceport. Jump onto the barrels and over the fence to avoid setting of the alarm. Fall down the elevator shaft. Head out to the Spaceport's landing area.

Get into the control tower and kill the guards at the stairs. Climb the ladder, and grab the Itinary token from the scientists. Go back down, outside and board the shuttle. Fly back to Twinsun.

On Citadel Island, escape from the Esmer, go downtown and enter the Baggage Claim. Go downstairs and get your crate out using the robot. Leave your crate and pay 102 Kashes to the worker. (Get the Kashes from the secret room further in the Baggage Claim). Go back to the entrance and receive the Proto-pack.

Go back home and talk to Zoé. Fly with Dino-Fly to Desert Island. Get past the guards to the other side of Port-Ludo, and call the turtle with the bell. Jump on her back, get into the pearl's cave, fly with the Proto-pack over the spikes and get the Pearl of Incandescense. Get back out the same way and go back to Dino-Fly.

If you want to, you can go to the Hacienda now, fly with the Proto-pack over to the Island across the Hacienda and get the Protection Spell.

Fly with Dino-Fly back to Citadel Island and head through the town to the Weather Wizard's tent. Put the pearl in the cauldron and get the Lightning Spell. Open the gate to the sewers and get onto the bridge. Do a running jump to get ontop of the middle platform. Alternately, go back to town and to the pub.

Saving Baldino
-------------

Upon landing on the Emerald Moon, give the correct password, Operation GREEN MOON. Get into the space suit and leave the shuttle. Enter the welcoming building and take the suit off again.

Destroy the green computer screen with your magic ball to distract the workers, hit the lever to open the door and follow Baldino. Take on your suit and head out of the base.

Gazogem
-------------

On Otringal, jump across the rocks and use your proto-pack at the rocks with the slopes to fly across the gas layer, then jump from the rock onto the harbour. Go to the Middle City and talk to the Franco at the gas station. Then go back to the harbour and to Rick's bar. Play at the slot machines until you've got 100 Zlitos, then go to the captain at the harbour, pay the money and get to Celebration Island.

Kill the guards and go up to the bandaged Franco who returned from Island CX. Talk to him, then go back to the docks. Wait for the taxi to arrive and take it to the island of the Francos.

On the island of the Francos, enter the shop and buy the pick-ax. Then head around the houses and dig for the Francos' fragment behind the shop. Now go to the pipes near the fence and jump from the pipes over the fence into the area of the Gazogem reffinery. Go to the back of the building and enter.

Run forward and jump over the water pool to the edge of the pools. Let yourself fall down into the lower area and take the elevator up to the Franco guard. Kill it and rotate the wheel. Take the elevator down again and get the key. Wait for the steam in front of the door to pause and run straight through the door.

In the next room, run past the steam when it pauses and take the elevator up to the guard. Jump across the room to the bottom left to the pools, then go to the pipes at the very bottom part of the room. Follow the path to the right and jump up the platforms, avoiding the steams on your way, to get the key out of the box. Jump across the pipes into the direction of the door and open it.

Kill the Franco in the next room to get the key. Make your way around the steams to the top right part of the room, then turn the left wheel once, then the right wheel once. Get onto the moving platform in discreet mode to avoid the steams. Get to the door and enter the last room.

Jump down, kill the guard and kill the Franco scientist from farther away with blowgun or magic ball and collect his key with your magic ball. Open the dog's cage, and run past them and up the stairs. Kill the guard who's hiding behind the door to get his key. In discreet mode, get past the steam on the steams up the stairs and turn the wheel to turn the steams off. Collect the Gazogem and get the key from the box. Go back down the stairs and exit through the back door. Drop down, jump from the barrels over the fence again, then go to the docks and take the taxi back to Otringal.

If you give Baldino the Gazogem now, you'll have to return to him later, so it's better to visit Rick first. Enter the pub and kill the big Wannie guards to get the key from one of them. Enter Rick's room and talk to him, then go back out and to Baldino, give him the Gazogem and receive your Super Jet-Pack in return.

To the undergas
-------------

From Baldino's, get back to the harbour and go up the slopes into the direction of the Middle City. At the waterfall on your way, use your Jet-Pack to cross the small river and fly to the door in the rock, then turn to the narrow path on the left. Run along and avoid the Franco soldiers who shoot at you.

On the island of the Francos, enter the area of the Gazogem reffinery again and get into the building to the far left, past the guards at the gate. Kill the Franco guard inside and use your pistol to shoot at the switches on the opposite wall. The combination to open both doors is, from left to right, Up, Down, Up, Down. When the doors open, run past the other guards to the harbour of the Francos. There, board the tanker and set off to the elevator to the Undergas.

Show the Queen the Dissidents' ring. In the test room, destroy the black balls to get a key out of one of them, and use it to open one of the doors to get the Blowtron. Once the Emperor's attack has started, fight yourself through the village and get out to the way to the island of the fragment. Collect the gem near the paratroopers and near the bridge, then cross the bridge and enter the cave.
